 <h2> Appearance</h2>
 <p>
    Himiko is a fair-skinned girl who is prone to blushing and
     is frequently described as having a pretty face.
      She has inward-tilting yellow eyes with thin slit-like irises,
       somewhat resembling those of a cat, and her wide mouth is also rather feline, 
       as her canines are pointed and longer than the rest of her teeth, 
       giving her a vampiric appearance. Her hair is a pale, ash-blonde color
        and is styled into two messy buns, with numerous wild strands sticking out, 
    a straight fringe and two chin-length side bangs framing her face.
